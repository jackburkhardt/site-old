Hello, I'm Jack Burkhardt. I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Philosophy at Northwestern University. My interests lie generally in political and ethical philosophy, social psychology, and in game design and system administration. I enjoy studying the philosophical and real world implications of a maturing internet and also designing story-based games that evoke emotion and fully utilize the power of games as an art form.  On this site you'll find my blog where I ramble incoherently about many things and a list of projects I've worked on. My resume is also available if that's what you're looking for.
 
At Northwestern I'm currently Technology Chair for [Shepard Residential College](https://shepardrc.com/) and involved with the Responsible AI Student Organization ([RAISO](https://twitter.com/raisotweets)). I'll also be doing media creation for [The Daily Northwestern](https://dailynorthwestern.com/) coming Spring 2021.
 
Previously I worked with the now-defunct [Chicode](https://chicode.org/), an organization promoting CS education in Chicago Public Schools, and founded the annual [Jones Jam](https://jonesjam.org/) 12 hour hackathon. I also support [CodeDay Chicago](https://event.codeday.org/chicago) events and hackathons as a student mentor, though those are currently on pause given the pandemic.
 
I don't have much of a social media presence nowadays, but you can reach me at mail **at** jackburkhardt **dot** com. I have a boundless appetite for knowledge and would love to talk.
