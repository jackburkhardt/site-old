**Calling all late adolescents and young adults!** -- I am currently collecting data about emerging adulthood for an upcoming game-related project of mine. A survey & more info can be found [here](https://northwestern.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_8JszDVPoFKyGtX8).

# About me
Hello, I'm Jack Burkhardt. I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Sociology at Northwestern University. On this site you'll find my blog where I ramble incoherently about many things, a list of projects I've worked on, and other info about me. My resume is also available if that's what you're looking for.

My interests lie generally in interactive entertainment, ethics, and social psychology. I enjoy studying the philosophical and real world implications of a maturing internet or designing story-based games that fully utilize the power of games as an art form. I am also getting more into human-computer interaction methods such as virtual and mixed reality.
 
At Northwestern I'm currently Technology Chair for [Shepard Residential College](https://shepardrc.com/) and involved with the Responsible AI Student Organization ([RAISO](https://raiso.org/)). I also serve on an undergraduate student advisory board to the Northwestern Computer Science department.
 
Previously I worked with the now-defunct [Chicode](https://chicode.org/), an organization promoting CS education in Chicago Public Schools, and founded the annual [Jones Jam](https://jonesjam.org/) 12 hour game jam. I also support [CodeDay Chicago](https://event.codeday.org/chicago) game jams and hackathons as a student mentor. On the side, I provide freelance web & gameserver hosting and development.

You can reach me at ([mail **at** jackburkhardt **dot** com](mailto:mail@jackburkhardt.com)). I have a boundless appetite for knowledge and would love to talk.
