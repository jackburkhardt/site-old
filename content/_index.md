Hello, I'm Jack Burkhardt. I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Philosophy at Northwestern University. On this site you'll find my blog where I ramble incoherently about many things, a list of projects I've worked on, and my personal reading list. My resume is also available if that's what you're looking for.

My interests lie generally in political and ethical philosophy, social psychology, and in game design and system administration. I enjoy studying the philosophical and real world implications of a maturing internet and designing story-based games that evoke emotion and fully utilize the power of games as an art form. I am also getting more into choice architecture in games as well as human-computer interaction methods such as virtual and mixed reality.
 
At Northwestern I'm currently Technology Chair for [Shepard Residential College](https://shepardrc.com/) and involved with the Responsible AI Student Organization ([RAISO](https://raiso.org/)). I'll also be doing media creation for [The Daily Northwestern](https://dailynorthwestern.com/) coming Spring 2021.
 
 Previously I worked with the now-defunct [Chicode](https://chicode.org/), an organization promoting CS education in Chicago Public Schools, and founded the annual [Jones Jam](https://jonesjam.org/) 12 hour game jam. I also support [CodeDay Chicago](https://event.codeday.org/chicago) game jams and hackathons as a student mentor, though those are currently on pause given the pandemic. On the side, I do web and gameserver hosting & development and am a relatively active member in the [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io/) support server.
 
I don't have much of a social media presence nowadays, but you can reach me at mail **at** jackburkhardt **dot** com. I have a boundless appetite for knowledge and would love to talk.
