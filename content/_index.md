## About me
Hello, I'm Jack Burkhardt. I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Sociology at Northwestern University. On this site you'll find my blog where I ramble incoherently about many things, a list of projects I've worked on, and other info about me. My resume is also available if that's what you're looking for.
\
My interests lie generally in interactive entertainment, ethics, and social psychology. I enjoy studying the philosophical and real world implications of a maturing internet and designing story-based games that fully utilize the power of games as an art form. I am also getting more into human-computer interaction methods such as virtual and mixed reality.
\
I'm involved in a few different things at Northwestern:
\
- Production assistant for [Dillo Day](https://dilloday.org/), the largest student-run music festival in the United States
- Electronics subteam member for [Northwestern Formula Racing](https://northwesternformularacing.com/), a team that builds and races Formula-style cars
- Education team member for [RAISO](https://raiso.org/), an organization that promotes ethical and responsible AI usage
- Technology Chair for [Shepard Residential College](https://shepardrc.com/), one of Northwestern's ten residential colleges
- I also serve on a student advisory board to Northwestern's computer science department
\
Previously I worked with the now-defunct [Chicode](https://chicode.org/), an organization promoting CS education in Chicago Public Schools, and founded the annual [Jones Jam](https://jonesjam.org/) 12 hour game jam. I also support [CodeDay Chicago](https://event.codeday.org/chicago) game jams and hackathons as a student mentor. On the side, I provide freelance web & gameserver hosting and development.
\
You can reach me at ([mail **at** jackburkhardt **dot** com](mailto:mail@jackburkhardt.com)). I have a boundless appetite for knowledge and would love to talk.
