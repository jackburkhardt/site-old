Hello, I'm Jack Burkhardt and I'm from Chicago, IL. I am a undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Philosophy at Northwestern University. My interests lie generally in political and ethical philosophy, social psychology, and in game design and system administration. I enjoy studying the philisophical and real world implications of a maturing internet and also designing story-based games that evoke emotion and fully utilize the power of games as an art form.  On this site you'll find my blog where I ramble incoherently about many things and a list of projects I've worked on. My resume is also available if that's what youre looking for.

I don't have much of a social media presence nowadays, but you can reach me at *mail **at** jackburkhardt **dot** com*. I don't know much now, even about my own interests, but I have a boundless appetite for knowledge and would love to talk.
