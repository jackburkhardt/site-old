Hello! I am a third-year computer science student at Northwestern. I am the Lead Programmer for KeyWave, bringing the work of other team members to life in code. I am also a Software Engineer for Overture Games, where I help make instrument practice fun for music students.

I am passionate about using the power of computers to make fun, immersive, and thoughtful experiences. I have worked on several game projects, from small class projects like [*Willowâ€™s Quest*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/willowsquest/) and [*Roadkill*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/roadkill/) to full fledged games such as [*Intervallic*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/intervallic/) and [*KeyWave*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/keywave/). I also worked on the virtual reality art installation [*VastWaste*](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/vastwaste/), which has recently been featured at prestigious exhibitions including SIGGRAPH2022 and ISEA2022.

At Northwestern I am a producer for the [Dillo Day](https://dilloday.com) music festival and am an undergrad teaching assistant for various computer science courses. When not working on tech, I enjoy reading and writing, exploring forest preserves, and playing with my dog Sam.

You can reach me at ([hello **at** jackburkhardt **dot** com](mailto:hello@jackburkhardt.com)). I have a boundless appetite for knowledge and would love to talk.
