The Wii was the only home console I’ve ever owned, but with it came a world of classics in video games that I spent so much of my younger years lost in. In retrospect, I have no idea how I managed to stay entertained by the same 4 games for so long, but maybe that’s just a sign that my childhood imagination has left me.

One of the games I spent a ton of time in and enjoyed the most was *Wii Sports Resort*, specifically the Island Flyover game. Your mii is put in a small seaplane and you’re given five minutes to fly around Wuhu Island, the island where the rest of the games take place. As you fly, you collect various floating “i” bubbles by nearby points of interest or pop balloons with your little blaster. Despite being such a simple game, it’s somehow never gotten boring and I haven’t even found all 80 points yet.

When I moved on campus I decided to bring my Wii with me. Playing on a Wii is a pretty universal experience for most of my generation, so I figured it would be a hit among the people I lived with. Sure enough it was, but what really surprised me was how popular the Island Flyover minigame was and how many people enjoyed it. Soon enough everyone would be gathered around the common room TV late into the night, flying over Wuhu island.

This shared love of a very simple game got me really intrigued into what made it so appealing. After all, it is a single player game, so what about it made it so much more popular in a group than the many other multiplayer games that Wii Sports Resort had to offer? I’ve decided to examine just that and hopefully look for ways I can replicate the great experience a 2009 Wii game can offer.

The first thing I wanted to understand was *why* people enjoyed this game. For people in my generation who grew up playing it some of the love comes from a feeling of nostalgia, so I wanted to pry deeper into concrete reasons people enjoyed the game. I interviewed a lot of friends as they played, as well as did some digging on the internet. Here’s a collection of things i found after a quick search of reviews on places like Amazon and Metacritic:

“I enjoyed the flyover game where you pilot an Indiana Jones-era aircraft over the various features of Yuhu Island. If you're a fan of more professional flying games, pass this up. You can't "stall" and full aerobatics might call for a multi-jointed hand and wrist. But it is great fun to fly through mountain tunnels or between the cables of a suspension bridge!”

“My fave games are Cycling - though I realize pedaling with your arms isn't realistic,and Airplane Flyover. [...] It is kind of fun to crash your plane too and watch your Mii go flying out ejector seat style and parachute down before resuming flight.”

“Hours can be spent just doing the Island Flyover and collecting points of interest.”

“My favorite game (and my son's, for whom we theoretically bought this thing) is the airplane flyover.”
“On stressful days I find much relaxation from sitting down and enjoying a nice flyover the Wuhu Island in my plane”

“Island flyover is one of my favorites. You fly over beautiful Wuhu Island and find points of interest. It sounds boring, but it was very relaxing and pleasant. Wuhu Island has a ton of neat stuff.”

“My husband and I currently find ourselves strangely addicted to the island flyover game. That's where you fly a little prop plane (a cessna?) all over the islands looking for "i" points or shooting balloons. It is so peaceful and yet it compells you to keep looking until you have found all the hidden items.”

“My wife and I both loved the Island Flyover where you look for points of interest while flying a small plane”

These online reviews were super intriguing, and from them we can find some commonalities in what people enjoyed:

* Many people found the game relaxing and a good stress reliever
* The island was very pretty, full of secrets, and fun to fly over at different times of day
* People of all ages enjoyed it (granted, most people leaving these reviews are adults, but many got them for kids and ended up also liking it too)
* Hunting down all the “i” points was fun and intrinsically rewarding
* Despite being a singleplayer game, many people liked playing it with others

I also interviewed my fellow residents while they played as well as other friends of mine and many of them said the same things as above. Thinking back, these were also the exact same reasons I enjoyed this game too. Like most Wii games, Island Flyover was easy for people of all ages to be able to learn and understand with a simple yet fun gameplay loop and was pretty relaxing compared to some of the other Wii Sports Resort games.

But in the end, it’s just a game where you move around a map and look for points. There’s barely even a control scheme to learn. I could make that, right? Maybe even improve on it? In the interest of time I’ll end things here, but in the next post I’ll dig more into how I can replicate the strengths of this game in a modern lens.
