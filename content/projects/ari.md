*Ari* is a game I am working on with [Erin Park](https://erinpark.org) and Clover.

Ari explores themes of codependent relationships, guilt, and personal responsibility. It makes the player question the choices they make about how to help a friend in need. It recounts a single day in the main character's life that the player can play over and over again, making different choices each time to different outcomes. What is the right way to handle your friend's situation? What is the best way? Are those the same??

This game is intended to be the first implementation of my branching dialogue system [TalkTree](https://jackburkhardt.com/projects/treetalk). There is no planned release date.
