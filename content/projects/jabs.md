JABS was a homework assignment for Northwestern CS 376, made in roughly 3-4 days. Originally the title was TNAVN (Totally Not A Visual Novel) as a play on the rule in the assignment that we could not make visual novels. It sort of stopped making sense as a title after a while, so now it's called JABS (Just Another Box Stacker). The concept of the game is based on mobile app games of a similar genre and style.

The assignment requirements were just to make a simple 2D arcade-type game while implementing certain requirements for physics and object behaviors. My focuses when making this game were on simplicity and pleasing aesthetics, but I also used it as a time to experiment with camera movement, menus, and new ways to organize the technical systems of the game.
