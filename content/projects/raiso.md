Below is a list of presentations and discussions I've led for Northwestern's Responsible AI Student Organization [(RAISO)](https://raiso.org/). Unforunately our Zoom meetings are not recorded, but if I do manage to get a recording I'll link it too.

# May 5, 2021: Flappy Bird: Responsible vs. Addictive Product Design

This presentation was about addictive product design, using Flappy Bird as a launchpad for discussion. We explore different types of addictive software design and questions about government regulation, personal responsibility, and potential soultions.

# May 12, 2021: Facial Recognition Software: To see or not to see? Is there a choice at all?

This presentation discussed how facial recognition software works and the types of situations it's used in. Our discussion delved into potential implications of this technology, such as how accurate it has to be for widespread use and realizing that we are already in a world full of facial recogntion.

# May 19, 2021: Judging fish by their ability to climb trees: What exactly is intelligence?

This was a more abstract topic, and as a result I kept the presentation short to maximize our discussion. The presentation part covers different understandings of human and machine intelligence as well as categorizing where AI is at now and what conditions it may need to meet in the future to be truly "intelligent".

# May 26, 2021: Tiktok & China: Is data mining only bad when China does it?

We discussed the processes and uses for data mining, and then focused on some of the more ethical and political implications of the technology. We took a special focus into how Americans are put into a frenzy about China's data mining practices when in reality they are far from the only ones doing those things.
