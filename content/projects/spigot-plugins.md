Below is a collection of random miscellaneous Spigot plugins I've made over time, with links to their repositories. I don't guarantee updates or support for any of these and I have not tested them on versions of Minecraft other than those listed. I know for a fact that most  of the 1.8 plugins will break if you try to load them on 1.13+.

[Freezer](https://github.com/jackburkhardt/Freezer) (1.8.8) - A plugin for server admins to freeze player activity, designed for use in minigames or tournaments.
[WedBars](https://github.com/dilanx/WedBars) (1.8.8) - A plugin that's sort of like Bedwars, but not really. The names are different, after all!
[WedBarsServerHelper](https://github.com/jackburkhardt/WedBarsServerHelper) (1.8.8) - A utility plugin for managing WedBars maps with Multiverse-Core, mainly for use in our playtesting servers.
[nusmp-utilities](https://github.com/jackburkhardt/nusmp-utilities) (1.16.5) - An indev plugin containing many of the features seen on the Northwestern University Minecraft Server during its summer 2021 map.
