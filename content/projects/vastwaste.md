[VastWaste](https://www.ozgesamanci.com/#/vastwaste/) and [Mind the Debris](https://www.ozgesamanci.com/#/mind-the-debris/) are two versions of the same project I worked on as part of a research grant for Summer 2021. I worked under Prof. Ozge Samanci, an artist and instructor at Northwestern University. I am continuing my work under her as a work-study research aide.

The principal difference between these pieces is that *Mind the Debris* uses a HTC Vive with attached EEG sensors. The sensor data gets sent over to Unity and impacts parts of the installation, including music and collisions. The *VastWaste* version uses other sources of data to handle debris timing and frequency, such as ocean currents and Twitter data.

Details, pictures, and more information about this piece can be found on Ozge Samanci's website (hyperlinked above). I will not do a full writeup here like I usually do for my projects since she has already covered most of the information I would usually include!

## Exhibitions

VastWaste has been featured at several international media arts festivals, including but not limited to:

2022	27th International Symposium of Electronic Art, Barcelona, ES
2022	SIGGRAPH Art Gallery, Vancouver, BC

## Additional information & resources

I unfortunately cannot include a link to the code or build for this project until Prof. Samanci gives her express permission. However, my work on this project is highly documented and I would be happy to explain how some of the systems in this piece work on a higher level.

For documentation about the projection system, please see [this document](/vastwaste/VastWasteDocumentation.pdf).
