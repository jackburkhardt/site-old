**Project Start Date:** June 2021 | **Project Finish Date:** September 2021

*[VastWaste]*(https://www.ozgesamanci.com/#/vastwaste/) and *[Mind the Debris]*(https://www.ozgesamanci.com/#/mind-the-debris/) are two versions of the same project I worked on as part of a research grant for Summer 2021. I worked under Prof. Ozge Samanci, an artist and instructor at Northwestern University.

The principal difference between these pieces is that *Mind the Debris* uses a HTC Vive with attached EEG sensors, the data from which gets sent over to Unity and impacts parts of the installation, such as collisions. The *VastWaste* version uses other sources of data to handle debris timing and frequency, such as marine tide and Twitter data.

Details, pictures, and more information about this piece can be found on Ozge Samanci's website (hyperlinked above). I will not do a full writeup here like I usually do for my projects since she has already covered most of the information I would usually include!

# Additional information & resources

I unfortunately cannot include a link to the code or build for this project until Prof. Samanci gives her express permission. However, my work on this project is highly documented and I would be happy to explain how some of the systems in this piece work on a higher level.

For documentation about the projection system, please see [this document](VastWaste Documentation.pdf).
